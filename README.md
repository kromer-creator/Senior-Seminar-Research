## What can eigenvalues teach us about quantum fields?

I am researching the spectra of eigenvalues generated in many different ways. This is inspired by a paper entitled "Finite Quantum Chaos" written by Audrey Terras. I began this research in fall 2021 and will be writing a paper on my findings as well. 

### senior_seminar_current: 
* This is where I am storing all of my code to generate different eigenvalues
* Here, I create eigenvalues from the adjacency matrices of Cayley graphs of cyclic permutations, random adjacency matrices, random symmetric matrices, Uniform, and Poisson distributions

### Senior_Seminar_Stats
* Contains a collection of functions for statistical analysis on these algorithms, such as mean, standard deviation, etc.
* Displays the results from this analysis and contains observations made
