## What can eigenvalues teach us about quantum fields?

I am researching the spectra of eigenvalues generated in many different ways. This is inspired by a paper entitled "Finite Quantum Chaos" written by Audrey Terras. I began this research in fall 2021 and will be writing a paper on my findings as well.
