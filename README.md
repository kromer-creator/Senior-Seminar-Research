## What can eigenvalues teach us about quantum fields?

I am researching the spectra of eigenvalues generated in many different ways. This is inspired by a paper entitled "Finite Quantum Chaos" written by Audrey Terras. Thus far, I have done one semester of research. I have another semester to go, and will be writing a paper on my findings as well.
