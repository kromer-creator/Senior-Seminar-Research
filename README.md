## What can eigenvalues teach us about quantum fields?

For my math Senior Seminar project, I am researching the spectra of eigenvalues generated in many different ways. This is inspired by a paper entitled "Finite Quantum Chaos" written by Audrey Terras. I began this research in fall 2021 and will be writing a 10-page expository paper, which will be completed by spring 2022. 

### Eigenvalue & Graph Generation: 
* This is where I am storing all of my code to generate different eigenvalues
* I create eigenvalues from the adjacency matrices of Cayley graphs of cyclic permutations, random adjacency matrices, random symmetric matrices, Uniform, and Poisson distributions

### Statistical_Analysis
* Contains a collection of functions for statistical analysis on these eigenvalues, such as mean, standard deviation, etc.
* Displays the results from this analysis and contains observations made

#### [Google Drive Folder of Data Collection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Xgm2uUiUob-MiAytpJ6Yp9cBu1OCzeBp?usp=sharing)
* Contains multiple histograms from each eigenvalue generator

### Tools:
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python & Numpy
* SageMath
